# Hyperledger Sawtooth SDK

*Hyperledger Sawtooth* is an enterprise solution for building, deploying, and
running distributed ledgers (also called blockchains). It provides an
extremely modular and flexible platform for implementing transaction-based
updates to shared state between untrusted parties coordinated by consensus
algorithms.

The *Sawtooth SDK* provides a number of useful components that simplify
developing Rust applications which interface with the Sawtooth platform.
These include modules to sign Transactions, read state, and create Transaction
Processors. For full usage and installation instructions please reference the
official Sawtooth documentation below:
